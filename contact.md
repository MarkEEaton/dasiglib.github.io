## Why join DASIG?

DASIG was formed to support librarians already working with, or who desire to work with, data. This may include bibliometrics, collection development,  library functional data, or supporting the data practices of researchers on your campus.

DASIG welcomes all skill sets, from novice to experienced, and all we ask is you treat all other members with respect and consideration.

## Policy

DASIG seeks to provide a welcoming, professionally engaging, fun, and safe conference experience and ongoing community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery (including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.
