**The scale and speed of data creation presents libraries with opportunities and imperatives for working with data**. The Data Analysis and Services Interest Group (DASIG) exists to support growing needs for librarians to become proficient in data science practices. While there are many groups focused on a specific practice in the data pipeline, or working towards a deliverable, DASIG is a communication network to help librarians connect with learning resources, share insights, and further their skills and knowledge with data.
