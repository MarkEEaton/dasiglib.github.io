For fall of 2020, we will have three Open Meetings: September 25, October 30, and November 20. For each, we will have an informal presentation or two, followed by discussion.

We are opening up for submission! Due to the format, you might consider sharing aspects of working with data on a project that you normally wouldn't share as part of a journal publication or conference presentation. 

For instance, what was it like working with consortia usage data? How are you assessing data gathering throughout the library for activities like door counts, circulation, reference transactions, etc? Or what is something you wish you would have known/done at the beginning of a project and why?

Presentations should be no longer than 10 minutes, with discussion afterwards.

Since the meetings are remote, you can run your materials from your own computer and share your screen with the broader group.  

I'll reach out to each submission to schedule and hammer out details.
